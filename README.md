Phaser.js is a popular open source JavaScript framework for building games on the web. You can learn more about it here: https://phaser.io/

I wanted to try building a small game to try out the Phaser.js framework, and I came across [this tutorial](http://www.lessmilk.com/tutorial/flappy-bird-phaser-1) that turned out to be very helpful. 

After completing the tutorial, I tweaked a bunch of things like adding different graphics and messing with the constants to determine in-game physics. I also spent some time to make it somewhat responsive, so that it works on both desktop and mobile devices and registers touch screen as well as mouse input. 

I also did some research into the origin of the carp or koi myth told similarly in both China and Japan . The oldest relevant text is from approximately 900 AD, quoting a text from around 200 AD in ancient China...

- Link to actual Chinese text: https://ctext.org/taiping-guangji/466/longmen

Backstory: An old Chinese myth tells of carp that brave rapids and a strong current to swim upstream to a large waterfall. The fish with enough persistence and courage may eventually clear the gap, jump past the waterfall and turn into a dragon. 

Have fun splashing away! üéè
