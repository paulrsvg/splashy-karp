### Splashy Karp
=================

This little game is a flappy bird clone made with phaser.js
You can try it out [here] (https://splashy-karp.glitch.me/)

------------
I wanted to try building a small game to try out the phaser.js framework, and I came across [this tutorial](http://www.lessmilk.com/tutorial/flappy-bird-phaser-1) that turned out to be very helpful. 

After completing the tutorial I tweaked a few things like adding different graphics and such.
I also did some research into the origin of the carp or koi myth told similarly in both China and Japan . The oldest relevant text is from approximately 900 AD, quoting a text from around 200 AD in ancient China.
(add more links+research here)

Backstory: An old Chinese myth tells of carp that brave rapids and a strong current to swim upstream to a large waterfall. The fish with enough persistence and courage may eventually clear the gap, jump past the waterfall and turn into a dragon. 

Have fun splashing away! üéè
